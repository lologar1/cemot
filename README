CEMOT (CMT) — A small C program for querying the Littré French Dictionary

Usage
	Invoking cemot without any arguments opens interactive mode, while providing
	one or more words will output their definitions in that order.

	In command-line mode, cemot doesn't provide info output by default, but this
	can be enabled by specifying the -v flag before word queries.
	Note that a missing word definition will not warn of its absence if info output is off.
